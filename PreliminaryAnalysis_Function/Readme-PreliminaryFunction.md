# Aircraft-Preliminary-Design
**A MATLAB Function that Outputs the required data for the preliminary design of the Airframe.**
it is just an initial version of what would be achived in building MATLAB/Python Functions/Scripts/Program/Libraries 
that facilitate and efficiently increase the speed of the Aerospace engineer performed job!


### Documentation:
Outputs the required data for the preliminary design of the Airframe

 ***Input parameters:***
+ MTOW: Maximum Take-off weight of the plane
+ Static_Margin: Static Margin is The difference between the actual CG location and the neutral point
+ AR_Wing: Aspect Ratio of the Wing
+ V_stall: Stall velocity
+ Cl_max: Maximum coefficient of lift
+ TR: Taper Ratio
+ Volume_Hori: Horizontal Tail volume coefficient
+ Volume_Vert: Vertical Tail volume coefficient
+ SHori_per_SWing: Horizontal Tail Area devided by Vertical Tail Area
+ AR_Hori: Aspect Ratio of the Horizontal Tail
+ NeutralP_X: Neutral point on the X-axis 

***Output:*** Displays the needed data for the Airframe design in Preliminary stage including if the CAD Model is not provided

> Note!!! At first in your analysis consider the NeutralP_X to be nan then use XLFR5 to find the NeutralP_X in advanced stage of your analysis,
finally come and insert it again to continue!!!

> Note!!! New updates will be provided soon!
